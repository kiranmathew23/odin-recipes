    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy strawberry cheesecake is perfect for any special occasion! You have to bake the cake and let it cool for an hour, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen sweetened sliced strawberries, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Make crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; mix well. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Make filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</li>
    <li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer. Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top. Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.</li>
    <li>Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If sauce is too thick, stir in water.</li>
